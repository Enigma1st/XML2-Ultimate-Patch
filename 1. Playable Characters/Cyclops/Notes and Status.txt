Needs:
- Update script for tutorial1, sanctuary, infinite factory Sinister, and briefings
  - These maps will need the existing convo portrait hex edited out
  - Will also need to apply to CSP, loading screens, comic cover, and sounds
- Possible to add to cfgCreate to be able to set up a talents file with icons2?
- Compiler script
  - Need special routine for the visor boltons
  - Don't implement redesign or custom skins yet, but will need to ignore these options for GC and PSP
  - CSP, sounds, loading, comics are not part of this compiler; update script only
