Needs:
- Update script for tutorial1, sanctuary, infinite factory Sinister, and briefings
  - These maps will need the existing convo portrait hex edited out
  - Will also need to apply to CSP, loading screens, comic cover, and sounds
- Need a python script that can work with a batch file to create cfg files (including Xbox variants with icons2)
  - Batch does the moving, py edits the files
  - Can this be done for the talents file too? Decompile, replace text, compile
- Compiler script
  - Need special routine for the visor boltons
  - Don't implement redesign or custom skins yet, but will need to ignore these options for PS2 and PSP
  - CSP, sounds, loading, comics are not part of this compiler; update script only

Default assets:
- All: need to add sounds
- GameCube is missing skins and 3D heads
- PSP:
  - Currently using original PSP assets, 0106 and 0109 are duplicates of 0101
  - No updated icons
  - No boltons
  - No skin-specific portraits and they are not updated
  - Lacks extra loading screens, uses duplicates, is not updated
  - Comic cover is not updated
- Xbox:
  - Has unique cfg files and talents file
